DESCRIPTION:

This task focuses on building a fully automated report generation pipeline using Python. The objective is to read structured data from a CSV file or an in-built dataset, analyze it, and generate a professional PDF report using Python libraries like FPDF and Matplotlib. The script I created simulates a real-world reporting workflow by embedding a mock sales dataset with fields such as product names, sales numbers, and regions. After importing and processing this data with Pandas, the script computes essential statistical summaries, such as total sales, average per product, and performance by region. These insights are visualized using bar charts and pie charts created with Matplotlib, which are saved as image files and embedded directly into the PDF. The FPDF library is then used to generate a multi-sectioned PDF that includes a title page, tabulated data summaries, visual analytics, and a conclusion. A major strength of this task is its reusability: users can substitute the mock data with real-world business data to automate monthly or weekly sales reports. Error handling is implemented to catch invalid input files or empty dataframes. This solution reflects a scalable and practical tool that can be used in enterprises to replace manual reporting tasks. Moreover, the final report is neatly formatted with page numbering, headings, and section breaks to enhance readability. By automating such reports, this project demonstrates how Python can save countless hours of repetitive work and ensure consistent formatting and accuracy. The output includes both the source code and the generated PDF file, showcasing how to merge programming with documentation in a business-friendly way.
